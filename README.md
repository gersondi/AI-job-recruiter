# AI-job-recruiter chatbot
A recruitment chatbot – or “conversational agent” – is a software application designed to mimic human conversational abilities during the recruiting process.

Similar to virtual personal assistants such as Alexa, Siri, and Google Now, a recruitment chatbot uses AI technology such as natural language processing to understand a person’s messages and know how to respond.

A chatbot can be used within various media:
* email
* SMS
* social media profiles like Facebook
* messaging apps like Slack
* specific software such as an ATS

A chatbot can mimic a human’s conversational abilities in the sense that it’s programmed to understand written and spoken language and respond correctly.
