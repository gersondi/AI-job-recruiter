# AI-job-recruiter chatbot
A recruitment chatbot – or “conversational agent” – is a software application designed to mimic human conversational abilities during the recruiting process.

Similar to virtual personal assistants such as Alexa, Siri, and Google Now, a recruitment chatbot uses AI technology such as natural language processing to understand a person’s messages and know how to respond.

A chatbot can be used within various media:
* email
* SMS
* social media profiles like Facebook
* messaging apps like Slack
* specific software such as an ATS

A chatbot can mimic a human’s conversational abilities in the sense that it’s programmed to understand written and spoken language and respond correctly.

#### Description:
52% of talent acquisition leaders say that the most difficult part of their job is to shortlist the right candidate and 3% of candidates never hear back from a company after one touchpoint. On the flip side, it’s a challenge for employers to communicate well with all their candidates. For high volume recruiting, this would require communicating with thousands of candidates, in addition to a recruiter’s normal screening functions and other duties. Artificial Intelligence enabled software bots can definitely provide a solution for this problem.
